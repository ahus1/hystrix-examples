== Writing a real application with JAX-RS

=== JAX-RS as a standard for enterprise RESTful web application

JAX-RS is part of the JavaEE Standard. It defines how a JavaEE
application needs to be structured to respond to HTTP-REST-Calls.

REST calls have the following advantages:

. With their JSON-interface they can be interfaced easily from JavaScript clients.
. The REST API can also be easily tested for functional and load testing (see <<jmeter>> below).

=== RESTeasy as portable JAX-RS implementation

http://resteasy.jboss.org/[RESTEasy] by JBoss is a portable implementation of the standard. It adds also several enterprise
features like authentication and signatures.

As a portable implementation I can easily deploy it to a Tomcat
application server later.

=== Overview of classes to implement a JAX-RS service

You find the example application in the folder `hystrix-application`.

==== Application as the starting point

JAX-RS requires you to name all classes related to the REST part of your application. This class needs to extend `javax.ws.rs.core.Application`:

[source,java,indent=0]
.HystrixApplication.java
----
include::{javasourcedir}/de/ahus1/hystrix/base/HystrixApplication.java[tags=classdef]
----

This very basic setup lists the two REST endpoints `SimpleSaveAccount` and `HystrixSaveAccount` we will
look at later plus two exception handlers `ValidationExceptionMapper` and `InterruptedExceptionMapper`.

It also defines that the URL `/api` will be used for all JAX-RS requests relative to the application.

==== SimpleSaveAccount as REST endpoint

JAX-RS requires you to name all classes related to the REST part of your application. This class needs to extend `javax.ws.rs.core.Application`:

[source,java,indent=0]
.SimpleSaveAccount.java
----
include::{javasourcedir}/de/ahus1/hystrix/rest/SimpleSaveAccount.java[tags=classdef]
----

This defines for the URL `/simple` relative to the application defined above how to react on `GET` and `POST` requests.

A `GET`-Request will return with an empty `200 OK` response. This enables us to use a simple browser request to test the successful deployment of our application.

A `POST`-Request will have a parameter of type `Account`. If the account is invalid, it will throw an exception. Otherwise it will save the account. In our sample application the save operation is a dummy implementation that does nothing. After the save returned, the response is `200 OK`.

==== ExceptionMappers to handle Exceptions

Unhandled exceptions result in the application server to present a standard `500` error page that (depending on the application servers's configuration) might also include a stack trace of the application.

To avoid this and to return REST-ful error messages exceptions are mapped by an `ExceptionMapper`.

[source,java,indent=0]
.ValidationExceptionMapper.java
----
include::{javasourcedir}/de/ahus1/hystrix/base/ValidationExceptionMapper.java[tags=classdef]
----

== Equip your application with Hystrix

=== Ensuring a clean start up and shut down of Hystrix

When you want to run code at the start and at the end of a JEE Web application, the place for this is `@WebListener`. The servlet container will scan for classes with this annotation and run their `contextInitialized()` and `contextDestroyed()` methods.

To start up Hystrix there is nothing to do; you can just go ahead and use it.

I recommend a shut down of Hystrix as it starts several thread pools to do its job. Just add the line

[source,java,indent=0]
.HystrixSetupListener.java
----
include::{javasourcedir}/de/ahus1/hystrix/util/HystrixSetupListener.java[tags=hystrixstop]
----

As Hystrix uses Archaius as a default for runtime configuration, we should shut down it as well.

[source,java,indent=0]
.HystrixSetupListener.java
----
include::{javasourcedir}/de/ahus1/hystrix/util/HystrixSetupListener.java[tags=archaiusstop]
----

=== Wrap external interfaces as a Hystrix Command

The core of the application is now set up. To benefit from Hystrix each call needs to be wrapped as a Hystrix command.

[source,java,indent=0]
.HystrixSaveAccount.java
----
include::{javasourcedir}/de/ahus1/hystrix/rest/HystrixSaveAccount.java[tags=hystrix]
----
<1> constructing the wrapper
<2> memorizing the parameters
<3> calling the original code
<4> taking care of the additional runtime exception that originates from an exception of the services, or from the resilience functionality of Hystrix

When there is a problem with the Hystrix command there will be a `HystrixRuntimeException`. This will occur in two cases:

. Hystrix circuit breaker or time out handler are activated.
. The original command throws an exception.

[TIP]
If you want to handle the exceptions of your service as before, you will need to unwrap them.

== Live API documentation

=== Swagger creates a live API at runtime

http://swagger.io/[Swagger] allows you to annotate your REST endpoints. The information from the JAX-RS annotation and the Swagger annotations is collected at runtime.

=== Adding Swagger

To add Swagger to your project, annotate your REST endpoints with `@ApiOperation` and `@Api` annotations.

Add the following dependency to your Maven configuration:

[source,xml,indent=0]
.pom.xml
----
include::pom.xml[tags=swagger]
----

The following snipped is needed in your web configuration:

[source,xml,indent=0]
.web.xml
----
include::src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/web.xml[tags=swagger]
----

=== Accessing the Live API

The Live API will be deployed as part of the application. You can access it with your browser using the following URL: http://localhost:8080/hystrixapp/swagger/
